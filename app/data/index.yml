    s humans have evolved, so have our abilities
    to perceive and interpret the world around us.
    Aristotle is credited with being the first to
    classify the major senses — sight, smell, hearing, touch
    and taste — but sensory perception extends far
    beyond the “Big Five.” There’s no scientific consensus
    on exactly how many senses the human body has
    developed, as researchers hotly debate how many
    senses we actually have, ranging from
    equilibrioception, which detects balance, to temporal
    perception, that lets us sense the passing of time.

          Our senses not only help us navigate the world, they’re also crucial
          instruments that allowed us to become social creatures, form
          interpersonal bonds, and communicate how it feels to be us.
          Technologies are now using our innate senses as guideposts to
          create more sophisticated ways of discovering ourselves and our
          world, with investment potential in biometric applications
          flourishing in fields ranging from security to marketing.

        paragraphs: |
            It has taken millions of years for evolution to slowly fine-tune the
             senses our bodies use today. At first, bacteria were generally equipped
            to respond to only “the chemical milieu and whether they were bumping into
            something,” according to Paul Fuchs, co-director of the Center for Sensory
            Biology at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Our modern sensory systems have evolved
            to encompass millions of nerve, brain and organ cells all working together
            to transform data from our environments into information the body can use
            to navigate life and understand other social creatures.


      - caption: "Today, we are pushing sensory enhancements even further."
        paragraphs: |
          Technology has long lent a helping hand. For centuries, inventions
          like binoculars and hearing aids have worked in conjunction with
          our natural senses to make them better and sharper, sometimes
          enhancing beyond the body’s natural limitations.<br/><br/>

          While improving human senses is still an important part of
          technology, in recent years, technologies guided by data and
          information flow, and coupled with enhanced forms of our senses,
          are providing new ways of understanding ourselves. Emerging
          biometric and identity science technologies are using data to create
          new methods of analyzing our physical bodies and behavioral
          patterns, leading to novel ways of understanding ourselves and
          cracking problems once thought unsolvable. It's also leading to new
          opportunities in myriad fields that previously had never imaged
          using such technology.

  title: "Touch Sensitivity"
  paragraphs: |
      There are more than <a href=#" target="_blank">17,000</a> tactile units in the hand alone, and
      that’s just a small portion of the sensory receptors that make up our
      sense of touch. Believed to be <a href=#" target="_blank">the first sense</a> fetuses develop, touch
      is so important as a means of communication, establishing intimate
      bonds and orienting ourselves in the world, it can actually <a href=#" target="_blank">shape
      chemical development</a> in the brain and have <a href=#" target="_blank">lasting physical and
      social effects</a>.
  copy:
    paragraphs: |
      Just as touch is vital for identifying our surroundings and the people
      in them, it’s also a key way for men and machines identify us.
      Fingerprint matching focuses on the minutia — the shape, endings and
      bifurcations of the ridges — which are so distinctive, not even identical
      twins share the same patterns. This extraordinary individuation has made
      fingerprinting (and fingerprint readers) a hallmark of law enforcement
      security and identification protocols, with technologies being used in
      areas spanning from artwork authentication and financial transactions at
      billion-dollar institutions, all the way down to elementary schools using
      fingerprint payment systems for students to buy lunch.

      “It’s the fusion of all
      this multi-sensory

      technologies that combine traditional fingerprinting with other
      non-biometric and biometric identification methods are being
      adopted to improve accuracy and make the biometric systems more
      secure.<br /><br />

      We have “a multitude of sensors (and) each one is capturing some

  title: "Facial Recognition"
  copy:
    paragraphs: |
      The ability to find friends, build communities and avoid foes is
      crucial to the survival of many species. So it’s not surprising that
      human babies recognize faces almost from the second they’re born.
      Research shows that infants mere <a href=#" target="_blank">minutes old</a> can recognize facial
      patterns and, within a couple days, <a href=#" target="_blank">can pick out</a> their mothers faces
      among a sea of others. By <a href=#" target="_blank">six months</a>, children are so adept at facial
      recognition, they can identify individuals within an animal species
       more accurately than adults can.<br/><br />

      Using <a href=#" target="_blank">some techniques</a> that mimic how cells in the visual cortex
      process information, facial recognition algorithms are catching up
      to their human counterparts. Widespread in the biometrics world,
      facial recognition programs are used by an enormous array of
      organizations, from <a href=#" target="_blank">law enforcement agencies</a> searching for
      suspects to <a href=#" target="_blank">bars and restaurants identifying loyal customers</a> to
      <a href=#" target="_blank">mining companies</a> detecting whether machine operators are alert
      or drowsy.

      There are about 80 nodal points on the face, but facial
      recognition algorithms often read fewer than half.

    text2: |
      Analyzing how features change, emotion ID systems can
      pick out signature emotions like happiness, surprise and disgust.

    text3: |
      Facial ID systems run a new image or video through a recognition
      algorithm and compare it with images on file.

    text4: |
      Algorithms identify sleepiness in the face by looking at head pose,
      blinking patterns and changes in facial muscles.

  copy4:
    paragraphs: |
      Facial recognition is endemic in next generation security protocols,
      and accuracy is improving as researchers gain access to broader data
      sets that can train algorithms for variations in poses, illumination,
      facial expressions, and image quality, says Damon L. Woodard, an
      associate professor in electrical and computer engineering and a faculty
      member at the Florida Institute for Cybersecurity (FICS) Research at the
      University of Florida.<br /><br />

      “In the next five years, I think more emphasis is going to be on the
      capability of doing biometric recognition under less and less
      constrained scenarios,” he says.

section5:
  title: "Iris Imaging"
  copy:
    paragraphs: |
      Crucial for nonverbal communication and interpersonal bonding,
      eyes have evolved to be noticeable and emotive. Designed to
      visually stand out — humans are one of the only primates with
      high contrast between the iris and the white part of the eye
      called the sclera — eyes are rich information portals that babies
      instinctually seek out. <a href=#" target="_blank">One study</a> published in Proceedings of the
      National. Academy of Sciences found that newborns as young as two
      days old show preference for people who gaze directly into their
      eyes rather than away. There are chemical reasons behind that.
      Sustained eye contact <a href=#" target="_blank">releases oxytocin</a>, a hormone associated with
      social bonding, which may explain the fuzzy feelings that come when
      gazing deep into a lover’s (<a href=#" target="_blank">or dog’s</a>) eyes.

  copy1:
    paragraphs: |
      Iris scanning has an advantage over other
      biometric identification methods because
      irises don't significantly change with age.

  copy2:
    paragraphs: |
      Eyes are valuable data hotspots for identification and security
      systems, too, in part because irises are far more distinctive than
      other biomarkers. Compared to 10-point DNA analysis, where the
      chance of two unrelated people having a match on 10 genetic
      markers and thus yielding a false identification is about one out of
      every billion (10<sup>9</sup>), the chances of two people having <a href=#" target="_blank">identical irises</a>
      is about drastically smaller (10<sup>78</sup>). Iris scanners have another major
      advantage over other biometric identification systems because,
      unlike faces and voices, irises don’t significantly change with age.

  copy3:
    paragraphs: |
        Iris recognition generally requires subjects to stay still and in close
        proximity to the scanner, says Woodard, but that may change soon.
        Emerging <a href=#" target="_blank">research</a> focused on long-range detection and
        video-based identification systems has the potential to revolutionize
        how iris scanning is used in security, identification and medical contexts.

section6:
  title: "Heart Rate"
  subtitle: "Heart Rate Monitoring"
  copy:
    paragraphs: |
      Fear, elation, stress and anger all can cause your heart rate to
      change, which can give away a shift in mood even if your facial
      expression doesn’t. Polygraph administrators have long used heart
      rate changes as a way to detect if a person is feeling more stressed
      than usual, but more recently <a href=#" target="_blank">marketers</a>,
      <a href=#" target="_blank">video game designers</a> and <a href=#" target="_blank">mental health professionals</a>
      are measuring heart rate variability to detect when users are excited
      and when they’re feeling down or bored.

  copy1:
    paragraphs: |
      Biometric tools designed to read changes in voice, scent, hormones
      and brainwaves are quickly becoming game changers across a
      broad spectrum of fields including sports and medicine. In an effort
      to build higher-performing, injury-resistant athletes, companies and
      sports teams are measuring neurological signals to determine how
      quickly athletes can detect and act upon approaching objects. They’re
      also monitoring heart rate to determine when athletes are becoming
      fatigued as well as body motion to perfect an athlete’s body symmetry
      and evaluate how they evolve (or devolve) throughout the season. When
      players get injured, sports scientists use gait and motion analysis
      to help determine why the injury happened and ways to correct and
      prevent it. Even when the season is over, teams still use biometric
      technologies to analyze sleep patterns to ensure that players are
      fully rested.<br /><br />

      As the field of biometric applications expands — it’s projected to be a
      $44.2 billion worldwide market by 2021 — so do research and
      investment opportunities. Where that brain and financial power
      gets directed will determine what technologies are built and how
      those biometric devices use our physicality and physiological
      processes to create new ways of understanding and interpreting
      our world.<br /><br />

            In combination with other biometric markers, heart rate can

            Heart rate can be monitored throughout an activity — swimming or
            soccer training for instance — to pinpoint when an athlete starts
            becoming fatigued and if they're hitting their target rest zone
            during breaks.

            Measuring beat variations in the heart can help evaluate endurance,
            which can be useful for runners. It can also be used as an indicator
            into how calm athletes stay under pressure, such as for archers lining
            up the perfect shot.
