    s humans have evolved, so have our abilities
    to perceive and interpret the world around us.
    Aristotle is credited with being the first to
    classify the major senses — sight, smell, hearing, touch
    and taste — but sensory perception extends far
    beyond the “Big Five.” There’s no scientific consensus
    on exactly how many senses the human body has
    developed, as researchers hotly debate how many
    senses we actually have, ranging from
    equilibrioception, which detects balance, to temporal
    perception, that lets us sense the passing of time.

          Our senses not only help us navigate the world, they’re also crucial
          instruments that allowed us to become social creatures, form
          interpersonal bonds, and communicate how it feels to be us.
          Technologies are now using our innate senses as guideposts to
          create more sophisticated ways of discovering ourselves and our
          world, with investment potential in biometric applications
          flourishing in fields ranging from security to marketing.

            It has taken millions of years for evolution to slowly fine-tune the
            sensory perception instruments our bodies use today. What began
            with bacteria, which were generally only equipped to respond to
            “the chemical milieu and whether they were bumping into
            something” according to Paul Fuchs, co-director of the Center for
            Sensory Biology at Johns Hopkins Medicine, our modern sensory
            systems have evolved to encompass millions of nerve, brain and
            organ cells all working together to transform data from our
            environments into information the body can use to navigate life and understand other social creatures.

        paragraphs: |
          Technology has long lent a helping hand. For centuries, inventions
          like binoculars and hearing aids have worked in conjunction with
          our natural senses to make them better and sharper, sometimes
          enhancing beyond the body’s natural limitations.<br/><br/>

          While improving human senses is still an important part of
          technology, in recent years, technologies guided by data and
          information flow, and coupled with enhanced forms of our senses,
          are providing new ways of understanding ourselves. Emerging
          biometric and identity science technologies are using data to create
          new methods of analyzing our physical bodies and behavioral
          patterns, leading to novel ways of understanding ourselves and
          cracking problems once thought unsolvable. It's also leading to new
          opportunities in myriad fields that previously had never imaged
          using such technology.

  title: "Touch Sensitivity"
  paragraphs: |
      There are more than 17,000 tactile units in the hand alone, and
      that’s just a small portion of the sensory receptors that make up our
      sense of touch. Believed to be the first sense fetuses develop, touch
      is so important as a means of communication, establishing intimate
      bonds and orienting ourselves in the world, it can actually shape
      chemical development in the brain and have lasting physical and
      social effects.
  copy:
    paragraphs: |
      Just as touch is vital for identifying our surroundings and the people
      in them, it’s also a key way for men and machines identify us.
      Fingerprint matching focuses on the minutia — the shape, endings
      and bifurcations of the ridges —which are so distinctive, not even
      identical twins share the same patterns. This extraordinary
      individuation has made fingerprinting (and fingerprint readers) a
      hallmark of law enforcement security and identification protocols,
      with technologies being used in areas spanning from artwork
      authentication and financial transactions at billion-dollar
      institutions, all the way down to elementary schools using
      fingerprint payment systems for students to buy lunch.

      scanners while Hybrid or multi-modal identification technologies
      that combine traditional fingerprinting with other non-biometric
      and biometric identification methods are being adopted to improve
      accuracy and make the biometric systems more secure.<br /><br />

      We have “a multitude of sensors (and) each one is capturing some
      incomplete and noisy information,” Jain says. “It’s the fusion of all
      this multisensory information which gives a more sure way of

  title: "Facial Recognition"
  copy:
    paragraphs: |
      The ability to find friends, build communities, and avoid foes is
      crucial to the survival of many species. So it’s not surprising that
      human babies recognize faces almost from the second they’re born.
      Research shows that infants mere minutes old can recognize facial
      patterns and, within a couple days, can pick out their mothers faces
      among a sea of others. By six months, children are so adept at facial
      recognition, they can identify individuals within an animal species
       more accurately than adults can.<br/><br />

      Using some techniques that mimic how cells in the visual cortex
      process information, facial recognition algorithms are catching up
      to their human counterparts. Widespread in the biometrics world,
      facial recognition programs are used by an enormous array of
      organizations, from law enforcement agencies searching for
      suspects to bars and restaurants identifying loyal customers to
      mining companies detecting whether machine operators are alert
      or drowsy.

      Analyzing how features change, emotion ID systems

    paragraphs: |
      Damon L. Woodard, an associate professor in electrical and
      computer engineering and a faculty member at the Florida Institute
      for Cybersecurity (FICS) Research at the University of Florida, says
      that facial recognition is endemic in next generation security
      protocols, and accuracy is improving as researchers gain access to
      broader data sets that can train algorithms for variations in poses,
      illumination, facial expressions, and image quality.<br /><br />

      “In the next five years, I think more emphasis is going to be on the
      capability of doing biometric recognition under less and less
      constrained scenarios,” he says.

section5:
  title: "Iris Imaging"
  copy:
    paragraphs: |
      Crucial for nonverbal communication and interpersonal bonding,
      eyes have evolved to be noticeable and emotive. Designed to
      visually stand out — humans are one of the only primates with high
      contrast between the iris and the white part of the eye called the
      sclera—eyes are rich information portals that babies instinctually
      seek out. One study published in Proceedings of the National
      Academy of Sciences found that newborns as young as two days old
      show preference for people who gaze directly into their eyes rather
      than away. There are chemical reasons behind that. Sustained eye
      contact releases oxytocin, a hormone associated with social
      bonding, which may explain the fuzzy feelings that come when
      gazing deep into a lover’s (or dog’s) eyes.

  copy1:
    paragraphs: |
      Iris scanning has an advantage over other
      biometric identification methods because
      irises don't significantly change with age.

  copy2:
    paragraphs: |
      Eyes are valuable data hotspots for identification and security
      systems, too, in part because irises are far more distinctive than
      other biomarkers. Compared to 10-point DNA analysis, where the
      chance of two unrelated people having a match on 10 genetic
      markers and thus yielding a false identification is about one out of
      every billion (109), the chances of two people having identical irises
      is about drastically smaller (1078). Iris scanners have another major
      advantage over other biometric identification systems because,
      unlike faces and voices, irises don’t significantly change with age.

  copy3:
    paragraphs: |
        Iris recognition generally requires subjects to stay still and in close
        proximity to the scanner says Woodard, but that may change soon.
        Emerging research focused on long-range detection and
        video-based identification systems have the potential to
        revolutionize how iris scanning is used in security, identification and
        medical contexts.
